Menu

The game now features a basic menu which allows starting a new game several times (so long as ESC is pressed and the window isn't closed by other means).

Better movement
---------------

Controls have been changed to WASD and mouse.

Player now accelerates smoothly to a maximum speed, and collisions cause the player to deflect off the object instead of just stopping.

Resources and structures

End condition
