\section{Executive summary}

\section{Style and theme}

\emph{Zarmina} will be a top-down endless survival shooter with strong elements of tower defense and an economic orientation.

The game will be set in the near future, with the player as an early human colonist on the
planet \emph{Zarmina}.  The group of colonists unexpectedly finds this planet to be home to life which rapidly becomes hostile, and the whole group but you has been killed.  The story will not be expanded in detail.

\section{Gameplay}

The player will begin with a character with only a basic weapon, and a single reactor structure to protect.

Enemies will spawn offscreen and move towards the player's structures.  On reaching the structures, the enemies will damage them until they are eventually destroyed.

The world will contain scattered mineral resources

\subsection{Structures}

There will be numerous types of structures available to the player, but not so many as to create confusion and a very steep learning curve.

\begin{tabular}{lp{9cm}}
Name & Description \\ \hline
Reactor & Provides the \emph{power} resource.  When all power cores are destroyed the game ends. \\
Foundation & Serves as a minor protective barrier and a platform on which to build other structures. \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Enemies}

There will be many varied types of enemies which will require different strategies for successful defense.

\subsection{Resources}

power, minerals

\subsection{Endgame}

There will be no win condition.  Instead, the objective will be to survive for as long as possible.  The game will end when all of the player's structures are destroyed.

\section{Technical features}

\subsection{Collision detection}

No sophisticated collision detection will be required.  Testing for when an enemy reaches a structure can be done adequately by thresholding Euclidean distance.  Enemies will elastically avoid each other, eliminating the need for precise collision detection between them.

\subsection{Artificial intelligence}

Enemies will use A* pathfinding.
