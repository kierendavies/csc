\section{Introduction}

The premise of this assignment is that the movements of certain ants are being tracked to observe active areas.
The task for this assignment was to create a system for querying ant activity in certain ranges.

\section{Implementation}

The following classes were implemented.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Benchmark} --- reads data from the file once, and then automatically performs many queries with various parameters and prints benchmarking information.
	\item \texttt{Bins} --- stores data points as counts in discrete bins for more rapid retrieval, at the cost of a small degree of accuracy.
	\item \texttt{QueryParallel} --- whatever
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

All benchmarking was done on ``fatso'', a blade server owned by UCT with 4 cores and 24GB of RAM.

\section{Analysis}
